Recursive function:
	- A Recursive function is a function that calls itself.
	- The problem is solved by repeatedly breaking it into smaller problems, which are similar in nature to original problem.
	- The smaller problems are solved and their solutions are applied to get the final solution of the original problem.

Syntax:

int main()
{
	------
	rec();
	------
}

void rec()
{
	------
	rec(); /* recursive call */
	------
}


Note:
	- Ensure that each recursive call takes you closer to the base case(condition that end's the recursion) 
	  i.e. the size of the problem should be diminished at each recursive call.
	- The recursive calls should be made in such a way that we arrive at the end base case. If we don't do so, we will have infinite recursion.


Winding and Unwinding phase:
=> Winding phase:
	- Winding phase begins when the recursive function is called for the first time, and each recursive call continues the winding phase.
	- In this phase the function keeps on calling itself and no return statements are executed in this phase.
	- This phase terminates when the terminating condition becomes true in call.
=> Unwinding phase:
	- After the winding phase, Unwinding phase begins and all the recursive function calls start returning in reverse order till the first instance of function returns.
