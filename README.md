# C Programming Practice (Embedded Focus)

This repository contains structured C programming practice programs developed to build a strong foundation in **core C**, **advanced C**, and **Embedded C** concepts essential for low-level and system programming.

## 📌 Purpose  
The goal of this repository is to gain **in-depth mastery of the C programming language**, with a focus on **memory, pointers, and hardware-oriented programming**, forming a solid base for embedded systems, RTOS, and Linux kernel development.

This work supports preparation for roles in:
- Embedded Software Development  
- Firmware Engineering  
- Systems and Low-Level Programming  

## 📂 Topics Covered  

- Core C fundamentals  
  - Data types and memory representation  
  - Operators and control flow  
  - Functions and stack behavior  

- Pointers and memory management  
  - Pointer arithmetic  
  - Pointers to pointers  
  - Arrays vs pointers  
  - Dynamic memory allocation  
  - Common pointer pitfalls  

- Storage classes and scope  
  - `auto`, `static`, `extern`, `register`  
  - Lifetime and visibility of variables  

- Bitwise operations and low-level programming  
  - Bit masking and shifting  
  - Bit manipulation techniques  
  - Bitfields  

- Preprocessor and macros  
  - `#define` macros  
  - Conditional compilation  
  - Inline macros vs functions  

- Advanced C concepts  
  - Function pointers  
  - `typedef` usage  
  - `const` correctness  

- Embedded C specific concepts  
  - `volatile` keyword  
  - Memory-mapped I/O concepts  
  - Register-level programming examples  
  - Writing hardware-friendly and deterministic code  

## 🚀 Next Steps  
This repository serves as a strong foundation toward:
- Embedded systems development using microcontrollers  
- RTOS-based application development  
- Linux device driver and kernel programming  
- Performance-critical and memory-constrained systems  

## 🛠 Platform  
- Vim editor (terminal-based workflow) 
- GCC toolchain  </br></br>
