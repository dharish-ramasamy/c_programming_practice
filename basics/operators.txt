Operators in C programming are:

1) Arithmetic operators : 
		+ => addition,
		- => subtraction, 
		* => multiplication, 
		/ => divide, and 
		% => modulus.

2) Assignment operators :
		=   => simple assignment,
		+=  => plus and assign,
		-=  => minus and assign,
		*=  => multiply and assign,
		/=  => divide and assign,
		%=  => modulus and assign,
		&=  => AND and assign,
		|=  => OR and assign,
		^=  => XOR and assign,
		>>= => Rightshift and assign, and
		<<= => Leftshift and assign.

3) Increment and Decrement operator :
		I ) Pre-increment and pre-decrement => ++(operand) and --(operand)
		II) Post inclrement and post decrement => (operand)++ and (operand)--

4) Relational operators :
		== => equal to,
		!= => not equal to,
		<  => less than,
		<= => less than or equal to,
		>  => greater than, and 
		>= => greater than or equal to.

5) Logical operators :
		&& => Logical AND,
		|| => Logical OR, and
		!  => Logical NOT.

6) Conditional operator: ?: => Ternary operator(Test expression ? expression1 : expression2)

7) Comma operator : (,) => is used to permit different expressions to appear in situations where only one expression would be used.

8) sizeof operator :  the sizeof the operator is used to compute the size of the variable or datatype.

9) Bitwise operators :
		&  => bitwise AND,
		|  => bitwise OR,
		^  => bitwise XOR, 
		~  => one's complement,
		<< => left shift, and
		>> => right shift.

10) dot (.) and arrow (->) Operator : Member operators are used to reference individual members of classes, structures, and unions.
		(.)  => is applied to the actual object.
		(->) => is used with a pointer to an object.

11) Cast Operator : convert one data type to another.

12) addressof (&) and Dereference (*) Operator :
		(&) => returns the address of a variable.
		(*) => is a pointer to a variable.
